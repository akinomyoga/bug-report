`checkwinsize' had been processed in `get_tty_state ()' in bash-5.1
and before.  As explained in the change log, we do not want to call
`get_tty_state ()' in this context, but we can instead directly call
`get_new_window_size ()' to only process `checkwinsize'.  I attach a
possible patch [r39.checkwinsizeA.patch.txt] for this.
