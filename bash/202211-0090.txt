>         - should_optimize_fork: broke conditions for optimizing away the fork
>           for a simple command out of optimize_fork into new function, call
>           from should_suppress_fork and optimize_subshell_command. Call from
>           optimize_fork if (subshell_environment & SUBSHELL_PAREN), relying
>           on fact that CMD_TRY_OPTIMIZING is only set in a couple of specific
>           conditions
>         - optimize_fork: call should_suppress_fork only if startup_state == 2;
>           it does the extra checks for that specific case
>         - optimize_fork: call should_optimize_fork if we're in a (list)
>           subshell (subshell_environment & SUBSHELL_PAREN)
>         - optimize_subshell_command: set CMD_TRY_OPTIMIZING on the right side
>           of a `&&', `||', or `;' list as long as it's a simple command so
>           we can check with optimize_fork() when it's time to execute it
> 
> execute_cmd.c
>         - execute_in_subshell: call optimize_subshell_command for (list)
>           subshells to either set CMD_NO_FORK for simple commands or set
>           CMD_TRY_OPTIMIZING for likely candidates for later optimization
> 
> builtins/common.h,builtins/evalstring.c
>         - optimize_fork: renamed to optimize_connection_fork; changed callers
