Subject: [PATCH] Fix a problem that shadow `bind -x' is not removed from `bind -X'

Bash Version: 5.0
Patch Level: 11
Release Status: maint

Description:

  The command string for shadow `bind -x' key binding is not removed
  from corresponding cmd_xmap and therefore remains in the list of
  `bind -X'.

Repeat-By:

  With the following command, one can create shadow binding for `\C-t'
  and remove the binding. The binding is in fact removed and inactive
  after the unbind, but remains in the output of `bind -X'.

  $ bind '"\C-t\C-t\C-t\C-t":"hello"'
  $ bind -x '"\C-t":echo world'
  $ bind -r '\C-t'
  $ bind -X
  "\C-t": "echo world"

Fix:

  I attach a patch. In the patch, if the original binding
  corresponding to removed keyseq is `ISKMAP', its shadow entry
  `map[ANYOTHERKEY].function' is also checked if it is
  `bash_execute_unix_command'.


Best regards,
Koichi
