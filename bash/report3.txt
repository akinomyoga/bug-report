Subject: [PATCH: bash-5.0.0(2)-alpha] fix a bug that "bind -r" sometimes causes a segmentation fault

Bash Version:

  I used the following latest commit from the devel branch.

  commit bf5b8103d466fdbc3bfcdaa5e21a0d0c0dce7cba
  Author: Chet Ramey <chet.ramey@case.edu>

      commit bash-20180309 snapshot

Description:

  At the line lib/readline/bind.c:376, an uninitialized variable `ic' is used to assign a value to the variable `prevkey'.
  This assignment to `prevkey' should be later than the assignment to `ic'.
  This causes segmentation faults in Bash of the devel branch.
  There is no such problem in Bash 4.4.

Repeat-By:

  I noticed this bug in the following reduced case causing the segmentation fault, but it should depend on environments because accessing uninitialized variables generally results in undefined behavior.

  $ bash-5.0.0 --norc
  $ bind -r '\C-j'
  $ bind -r `\C-m`
  Segmentation fault

Fix:

  I attach a patch file.
