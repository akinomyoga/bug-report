Bash Version:
  devel branch (441078402919f6f0dd677cad18d55c7a89d294fc),
  5.1.8(2)-maint (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

Description:

  The key `page-up', which is supposed to be bound to the readline
  bindable function `history-search-backward' after commit 65822e50,
  does not actually work because of a typo in `lib/readline/terminal.c'.

Fix:

  I attach a patch.
