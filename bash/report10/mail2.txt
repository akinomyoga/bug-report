I also would like to see this problem fixed.  In this February, I
actually posted to this mailing list a patch fixing this problem (with
another patch):

https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2019-02/msg00038.html

Although the first patch was applied to the devel branch, the second
one which fixes this problem seems not to have been reviewed yet.  I
updated the patch to fit the current devel branch.  I attach the
updated patch.  Here is the description of the patch quoted from the
previous mail:

> In the second patch
> `0002-do-not-print-unbound-bindings-in-bind-X.patch', to correctly
> dump `bind -x' bindings, I created a new function

> `_rl_macro_dumper_internal' (lib/readline/bind.c).  However, the
> implementation of `_print_unix_command_map_internal' uses private

Note that in the attached patch the functions in Readline library,
`_rl_get_keyname' and `_rl_untranslate_macro_value', were made public
and used from Bash codes.  I think it is worth to make them a part of
public interface of Readline library.

Even if Chet does not use my patch and instead write a new code with
another approach for this, I am anyway happy as far as the problem is
fixed.
