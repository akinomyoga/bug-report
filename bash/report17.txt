Subject:  How to use PROMPT_COMMAND(S) without breaking other scripts

Hi, I have a question on the behavior of the new array PROMPT_COMMANDS
and the best practice to use it.

In coming Bash 5.1, the new array variable `PROMPT_COMMANDS' is
available in the replacement of `PROMPT_COMMAND'.  When the array
`PROMPT_COMMANDS' has one or more elements, the scalar version
`PROMPT_COMMAND' is disabled.

Is there a background that the scalar version is disabled in the
presence of the array version?  Because of this behavior, I am
wondering how to write a source script in the way not interfering with
other source scripts which might use either of `PROMPT_COMMANDS' or
`PROMPT_COMMAND'.

* If I use the newer form `PROMPT_COMMANDS+=(my-function)', other
  scripts that use `PROMPT_COMMAND' will be broken.  Maybe I can write
  in the following way to convert `PROMPT_COMMAND' to
  `PROMPT_COMMANDS', but it still does not resolve the problem of the
  scripts sourced after my script.

  if [[ $PROMPT_COMMAND ]]; then
    PROMPT_COMMANDS+=("$PROMPT_COMMAND")
    unset PROMPT_COMMAND
  fi
  PROMPT_COMMANDS+=(my-function)

* If I use the older form with `PROMPT_COMMAND', it will be broken
  when another script sets the variable `PROMPT_COMMANDS'.  Maybe I
  can switch to `PROMPT_COMMANDS' only when the array already exists,
  but it again does not work when the other script sourced after mine
  newly sets `PROMPT_COMMANDS'.

  if ((${#PROMPT_COMMANDS})); then
    PROMPT_COMMANDS+=(my-function)
  else
    PROMPT_COMMAND="my-function${PROMPT_COMMAND:+;}$PROMPT_COMMAND"
  fi

Here, my question is what is the best practice to use the new array
variable `PROMPT_COMMANDS' in the way that it does not break the
conventional scripts that use `PROMPT_COMMAND'.

There's no real good solution. I wanted a clean break between the scalar
and array versions, figuring that the distributions that populated
PROMPT_COMMAND could easily make that PROMPT_COMMANDS[0].

It would be easy enough to favor PROMPT_COMMANDS over PROMPT_COMMAND,
but execute both if both are set. The problem there is that it
interferes with the ability to use both, as some distros might want as a
transition, and result in commands being executed twice. Since you have
to check the bash version to make sure that PROMPT_COMMANDS is going to
work, I don't think it's going to be that hard to use one or the other
consistently.

I sometimes think I should have stuck with converting PROMPT_COMMAND to
an array. Either way, there's going to be a transition, and maybe that
would have been the easiest.

Thank you for your reply.  OK, if there would be no better solution, I
would go with the first option (to convert PROMPT_COMMAND to
PROMPT_COMMANDS and append mine to PROMPT_COMMANDS) and see if
something happens.

Now I see the points.  I didn't come to the idea to set the values to
both as I somehow unconsciously assumed that everyone checks the Bash
version when one uses PROMPT_COMMANDS.  Thank you for pointing this
out.  This means that I need to be careful if I would convert
PROMPT_COMMAND set by others into PROMPT_COMMANDS.

Is it too late? I think that would actually be cleaner than adding a
separate array, per Koichi's report.

One problem is that if a script does the obvious

     PROMPT_COMMAND+=("some command here")

if PROMPT_COMMAND is not yet set, then it starts adding at array index
0, so a subsequent traditional usage from some other script

     PROMPT_COMMAND="some command here"

would overwrite it. So array usage should not use the 0 index. To avoid
using the 0 index, one possibility is:

     PROMPT_COMMAND[$(( ${#PROMPT_COMMAND[@]} + 1 ))]="some command here"

which, if PROMPT_COMMAND is unset, starts adding at index 1, not 0, and
otherwise acts identically. However, 'set -u'/'set -o nounset' kills
that. That option makes the ${#PROMPT_COMMAND[@]} expansion error out if
there are no array elements (even though ${#@} works with no positional
parameters). It's also an unwieldy command. So maybe that idea is not
the best.

Another way to avoid using the 0 index, which is 'set -u' compatible,
would be

     PROMPT_COMMAND=${PROMPT_COMMAND-}
     PROMPT_COMMAND+=("some command here")

The first command sets PROMPT_COMMAND[0] to the empty value if it
doesn't exist yet, and otherwise leaves it unchanged. It's a bit of an
ugly hack though.

But then, maybe it's best if bash itself just sets PROMPT_COMMAND[0] to
the empty value on initialisation. IMO that would be a reasonably clean
and reliable way to ensure a smooth transition.

Just my 2¢,

色々書いたけれども自明な事しか書いていないのでやめた。
結局伝えたいのは "自分は賛成" という事だけなのである。

If it's not too late to change, converting PROMPT_COMMAND to an array
looks better to me too.  As for the problem of scripts doing
`PROMPT_COMMAND=command', as suggested in the last paragraph from
Martijn, I think it is enough to initialize PROMPT_COMMAND[0] by an
empty string.
