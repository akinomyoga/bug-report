>         I want to read an associative array. Like so: y="${aa[$i]}"

>         If aa does not contain such an element, the result is the

I also noticed a memory leak early this month in testing my new
extglob implementation and was planning to submit a patch later. I now
checked this report and confirmed that this is actually caused by the
same part of the code. Here, I attach my patch
[r0037.parameter_brace_expand_word.memleak.patch], though I haven't
yet carefully tested it because I originally planned to submit it
sometime later.
