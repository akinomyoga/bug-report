Thank you for the patch fixing the problem. I cherry-picked the patch
and tried, but there is another problem.

Description:

  The programs compiled with "-mwindows" cannot read more than one
  character from PTY in a non-canonical mode.  There was no
  problem before the patch "Cygwin: pty: Fix reopening slave in
  push_to_pcon_screenbuffer().".

Repeat-By:

  1. Open Cygwin Terminal (mintty)

  2. Compile the attached program with the following commands.

    $ g++ -o minimal2-con.exe minimal2.cpp
    $ g++ -mwindows -o minimal2-win.exe minimal2.cpp

  3. The expected behavior can be checked with `minimal2-con'.  After
    executing the command, please type some five characters.  The
    string `[RECV]' will be printed five times, and then the program
    will exit.

    $ ./minimal2-con
    [RECV][RECV][RECV][RECV][RECV]
    $

  4. However, with the compile option "-mwindows", we can only see one
    `[RECV]', and the program will hang.

    $ ./minimal2-win
    [RECV]


Best,

Koichi
