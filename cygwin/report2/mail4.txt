Details:

  I use the commit 5377a8477 and cherry-picked the patch da4ee7d60.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

By the way, I have a question on the way how to try the latest version
of `cygwin1.dll'.  I am currently just replacing
`C:\cygwin64\bin\cygwin1.dll' with the version I built from recent
commits as explained in the description on trying Snapshots.

  https://cygwin.com/faq.html#faq.setup.snapshots


  But after the following commit, I cannot use this naive
approach.

  6cc299f0e - (2 days ago) Cygwin: pty: Revise code waiting for
  forwarding by master_fwd_thread. - Takashi Yano

If I replace the file with the latest one, any cygwin program fails to
start with the following error message.

  shared_info::initialize: size of shared memory region changed from
  XXXXX to XXXXX

I would appreciate it if you could provide me the correct way to test
the latest cygwin1.dll.  (If one would need to rebuild all the
toolchain for each small change of `cygwin1.dll', it would be too
inconvenient, so I guess there would be a smart way.)


Best,

Koichi
